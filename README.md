# Realistic Village Scene with Day–Night Cycle (OpenGL)

## Overview
This project is a 2D Computer Graphics application built using C++ with OpenGL and GLUT.
It represents a realistic village environment with a smooth Day–Night cycle where the
Sun and Moon movement is fully synchronized with the sky color transition.

---

## Features
- Smooth Day → Night → Day transition
- Sun and Moon aligned with the time cycle
- Realistic village scenery (houses, trees, river, road, hills)
- Animated objects (clouds, birds, boat, car, bus, windmill)
- Keyboard-controlled interactions
- Modular and well-structured code

---

## Day–Night & Sun–Moon Connection
A single time variable `sunAngle` controls:
- Sun and Moon position
- Day/Night state
- Sky color blending

This ensures perfect synchronization between:
- Sun movement
- Moon appearance
- Sky transition

---

## Technologies Used
- C++
- OpenGL
- GLUT

---

## Graphics Concepts Implemented
- Graphics primitives (points, lines, polygons, circles)
- DDA Line Drawing Algorithm
- Bresenham Line Drawing Algorithm
- Midpoint Circle Algorithm
- 2D Transformations (translation, rotation, scaling)
- Animation using frame updates

## Controls
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| D   | Switch to Day mode |
| N   | Switch to Night mode |
| P   | Toggle playground |
| Others | Control animations |

---

## Project Objective
To demonstrate core Computer Graphics concepts through a real-world themed,
animated OpenGL project that is original and beyond basic lab tasks.
